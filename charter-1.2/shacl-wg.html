        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>The primary motivations for forming this working group are to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>provide SHACL handling of for RDF-star and SPARQL-star</li>
          <li>make minor updates to the SHACL core and extended specifications from 5+ years experience of their use</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The secondary motivation is to:</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>develop new specifications that assist with extended SHACL use</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For this secondary motivation, the areas of UI generation, reasoning rule definition and profiling descriptions are expected to be addressed. Others may be too, pending resourcing.</p>

          This Working Group is formed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>update SHACL in line with 1.2 version updates to RDF &amp; SPARQL, the core Semantic Web standards that SHACL is built on</li>
          <li>extend the specification of advanced use of SHACL in line with use observed since 2017 & SHACL 1.0</li>
          <li>develop new SHACL-based specifications in the areas of:
            <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
              <li>auto-generation of user interfaces to RDF graphs</li>
              <li>reasoning rules - their dependencies, ordering and packaging</li>

                This specification will basically be an updated and slightly extended version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#part1">first part the SHACL 1.0 spec</a>.
                It should fix some unfinished issues in SHACL 1.0, such as recursion.
                A goal is maximum backwards compatibility.

                This specification will define a richer vocabulary that can be queried by user interface tools to produce renderings of RDF graphs,
                in particular for viewing and editing RDF resources on forms.

              <p>
                This specification will define a SHACL vocabulary to represent inferencing rules that can be used to infer new RDF statements from existing statements.
                A starting point may be the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-af/#node-expressions">Node Expressions</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-af/#rules">SHACL Rules</a>

              </p>
              <p>
                This work will likely build on the profile definitions of the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/">Profiles Vocabulary</a> which has been used extensively with SHACL constraints and the proposed <strong>SHACL 1.2 Inferencing Rules</strong>.

              This Working Group will take a phased approach to producing the individual deliverables as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Phase 1</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>SHACL 1.2 Core</li>
                  <li>SHACL 1.2 SPARQL Extensions</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>all other proposed deliverables</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Timing of Phase 1 is dependent on the work of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rdf-star/">RDF-star Working Group </a> (see <a href="#liaisons">Dependencies</a>, below). The time that this WG needs for the substantive work of Phase 1 is not expected to be great - single figure months - given work to date (see the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Phase 2 timing is unknown but is expected to take more than one year, even if the individual Deliverables are worked on in parallel, given the new material needed for some of them, in particular <strong> Inferencing Rules</strong> and <strong>Profiling</strong></p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.</p>
      <p>Already the current version of SHACL has test suites and implementations (see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/data-shapes/data-shapes-test-suite/">the current SHACL Test Suite and Implementation Report</a>). We expect to extend this work to cover all the new elements added in the Core and SPARQL Extensions specifications and to create similar Test Suites and Implementation Reports for the other normative specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members of the proposed WG include contributors to the following existing SHACL implementations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/TopQuadrant/shacl">TopBraid SHACL API</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL">pySHACL</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/index.html">Apache Jena SHACL</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other implementations that will be approached are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf">dotNetRDF</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://project.inria.fr/corese/">Corese</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        All previously known implementers will be contacted and invited to extend their implementations.

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Data Shapes Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Data Shapes Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-shacl@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-shacl/">archive</a>)
          and via <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/shacl/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
